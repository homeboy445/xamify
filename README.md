<h2>Motivation behind the idea.</h2>
<h3>Let's face it, online exams can be a pain specially when you have to write all the answers down manually with the same old paper and pen, and also submit it...(via a lot more exhausting methodologies) isn't it booooring?😒 Well, this is exactly what we always felt and so we thought why not fix that and so we ended up creating this beast - Xamify which we're sure will make you ❤ exams, given its awesome features.</h3>
