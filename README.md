<h1>Xamify - a student's personal superhero!</h1>
<h3>Xamify is an exam-taking platform for every student who hates online exams.</h3>
<br/>
<h2>Motivation behind the idea.</h2>
<h3>Let's face it, online exams can be a pain specially when you have to write all the answers down manually with the same old paper and pen, and also submit it...(via a lot more exhausting methodologies) well, isn't it booooring😒 Well, this is exactly what we always felt and so we thought why not fix that and so we ended up creating this beast - Xamify which we're sure will make you an ❤ exam lover given its awesome features.</h3>
